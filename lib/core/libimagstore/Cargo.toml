# Enable panic!()s if critical errors occur.
#
# # Howto
#
# To enable this, put
#
# ```toml
# [features]
# early-panic = [ "libimagstore/early-panic" ]
# ```
#
# In the crate depending on this library and compile your crate with
# `cargo build --features early-panic`. This way, the `libimagstore`
# implementation fails via `panic!()` instead of propagating errors which have
# to be printed somewhere to be visible.
#
# # WARNING
#
# The behaviour of the store implementation might be broken with this, resulting
# in partially written store entries and/or worse, so this is
#
#    _NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE_!
#
early-panic=[]

# File system locking
#
# Enable this feature to enable file-system locking in the store.
