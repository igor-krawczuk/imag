## Habit {#sec:modules:habit}

The Habit module is a habit tracker. One can add habits, specify how often they
should be done and instantiate them.

Example: After creating a new habit "Sunday Run", which should be done on
Sundays, one can mark that the habit was done.
Statistics and number-crunching can be done later on, after there is some habit
data there.

Exports to CSV are possible.
